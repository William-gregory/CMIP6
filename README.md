# CMIP6
Code used to download and extract data from CMIP6 models. The executable file cmip6_download_and_extract.py must be run on the UK computer server JASMIN, where it will search the JASMIN directories for available model ensembles which match the input description provided by the user. If it cannot find any files, it will resort to downloading the files remotely from the CMIP6 data portal (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/) by using the download script created by Thiago Loureiro (https://github.com/tloureiro/cmip6_downloader).

Here are two examples. The first shows an example of where the data are available on JASMIN, and the second where they must be downloaded.
